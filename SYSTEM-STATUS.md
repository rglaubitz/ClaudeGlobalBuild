## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### To Begin Using the System

1. **Start Claude Code** with the new configuration
2. **Run Boot Sequence**: Type `/daddy's-home` 
3. **Check System Status**: Run `~/.claude/scripts/dashboard.sh`
4. **Test MCP Servers**: Verify tools are available
5. **Begin Work**: System is ready for autonomous operation

### Key Commands to Remember

- `/daddy's-home` - Initialize system
- `/reflect` - Evaluate session performance
- `/unfuck-this` - Emergency recovery
- `~/.claude/scripts/backup.sh` - Manual backup
- `~/.claude/scripts/dashboard.sh` - System status

## ⚡ Power Questions Reminder

Always ask:
1. **"What tools or approaches did I miss?"** ← THE GAME CHANGER
2. "What would someone smarter than me do here?"
3. "What's the 10x solution, not the 10% improvement?"
4. "What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?"
5. "How would I solve this if I had unlimited resources?"

## 🏆 System Score: 7/10

**Why 7/10?**
- ✅ Foundation complete and robust
- ✅ Core systems operational
- ✅ Backup and recovery tested
- ✅ Memory and context ready
- ✅ Agents configured
- ⚠️ MCP servers need activation (requires Claude restart)
- ⚠️ Automation not yet scheduled
- ⚠️ Integration testing pending

**To Reach 10/10:**
1. Activate and test all MCP servers
2. Schedule automation cron jobs
3. Complete integration testing
4. Measure performance baselines
5. Run 24-hour stability test
