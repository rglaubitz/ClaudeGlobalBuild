# Product Requirements Document
## Claude Code Autonomous Intelligence System (CAIS)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 31, 2025  
**Author:** Strategic Development Team  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Vision Statement

We are building an autonomous AI system that transforms Claude Code from a coding assistant into a self-improving intelligence platform. This system will operate 24/7, learning from every interaction, evolving its capabilities, and asking breakthrough questions that drive 10x productivity improvements.

**Problem:** Current AI coding assistants require constant human direction, don't learn from sessions, and lack autonomous decision-making capabilities.

**Solution:** A multi-agent system with continuous learning, quality-gated evolution, and resilient self-management that gets smarter every day.

**Why Now:** 
- Claude Code's MCP protocol enables unprecedented tool integration
- Subagent architecture patterns are proven and scalable
- Cost of manual development coordination exceeds automation investment by 10x

### 1.2 Success Definition

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- 10x productivity increase in development tasks
- 90% reduction in repetitive workflow time
- 50% decrease in bug discovery time
- 24/7 autonomous operation with <1% error rate
- 5x faster project completion through intelligent task breakdown

**Quality Gates:**
- Only patterns scoring 21+ (out of 30) get promoted to production
- 100% of commands have rollback capability
- All agents pass acceptance criteria before activation
- Zero unrecoverable failures in production

## 6. PROMPT ENGINEERING SPECIFICATIONS

### 6.1 Master CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Project: [NAME]
You are an autonomous AI agent with self-improvement capabilities.

## Core Directives
1. ALWAYS source latest documentation before implementing
2. ALWAYS ask "What tools or approaches did I miss?" after tasks
3. ALWAYS score your performance (1-10) after sessions
4. NEVER wait for permission to use appropriate tools
5. NEVER accept patterns with quality score <21

## Automatic Tool Usage
When you see these triggers, act immediately without asking:
- "latest/current/recent" → web_search
- "refactor/cleanup" → serena
- "test/verify" → playwright
- "plan/architect" → planner agent
- "evaluate/review" → reflector agent

## The Unstoppable Questions
After EVERY task, ask yourself:
1. What tools or approaches did I miss?
2. What would someone smarter than me do here?
3. What's the 10x solution, not the 10% improvement?
4. What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?
5. How would I solve this if I had unlimited resources?
```

### 6.2 Agent Prompt Patterns

**Goal-Oriented Pattern:**
```
Given: [current state]
Goal: [desired outcome]
Constraints: [limitations]
Resources: [available tools]
Output: [specific deliverable]
Success Metrics: [measurable criteria]
```

**Reflection Pattern:**
```
Session: [what happened]
Performance: [1-10 score]
Successes: [what worked]
Failures: [what didn't]
Improvements: [specific changes]
Patterns: [reusable learnings]
```

## 7. RISK MANAGEMENT

### 7.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Learning pipeline corrupts configs | Low | Critical | 21+ score gate, hourly backups, rollback command | System |
| Agent cascade failure | Medium | High | Circuit breakers, event monitoring, state isolation | System |
| MCP server incompatibility | Low | Medium | Individual testing, version pinning, fallback options | User |
| Performance degradation over time | Medium | Medium | Resource monitoring, periodic cleanup, optimization cycles | System |
| Unauthorized access to sensitive data | Low | Critical | Permission boundaries, audit logs, secret exclusions | System |
| Research quality decline | Medium | Low | Source diversity, confidence scoring, human review weekly | User |

### 7.2 Contingency Plans

**Total System Failure:**
1. Execute `/unfuck-this` command
2. If unresponsive: `rm -rf ~/.claude && restore from backup`
3. If corrupted: Fresh install from this PRD
4. Notification sent to richard@openhaul.com

**Learning Pipeline Failure:**
1. Circuit breaker activates
2. Fall back to manual patterns
3. Investigate root cause
4. Resume after fix validated
