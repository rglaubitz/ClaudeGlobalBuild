# Claude Global Project - Task Management System
> Last Updated: 2025-09-02 | Current Phase: 1 - Infrastructure | Status: In Progress

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Transform Claude Code into an autonomous AI system through systematic 6-phase implementation, leveraging MCP servers, multi-agent architecture, and continuous learning pipelines.

## 📋 Phase Execution Workflow

### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Each Phase:
1. **📖 Read Phase Review** → `phase-X-*/phase-review.md` (understand base requirements)
2. **🚀 Read Enhanced Review** → `phase-X-*/phase-review-enhanced.md` (understand production features)
3. **📐 Study Implementation Strategy** → `implementation-strategy.md` (Day X instructions)
4. **✅ Execute Original Tasks** → `phase-X-*/task-list.md` (foundation)
5. **⚡ Execute Enhanced Tasks** → `phase-X-*/task-list-enhanced.md` (production features)
6. **🔍 Validation & User Review** → Complete checklist, await user grade
7. **➡️ Proceed to Next Phase** → Only after approval

## 🚨 Implementation Guidelines & Anti-Hallucination Measures

### Before Starting ANY Task:
```bash
# ALWAYS verify current state first
claude mcp list              # Check MCP connections
ls ~/.claude/                # Verify directory structure exists
which docker                 # Confirm Docker installed (if needed)
```

### Documentation Lookup Hierarchy:
1. **Local Project Docs** → `/ClaudeGlobal/mcp-documentation/`
2. **Serena Memories** → `mcp__serena__list_memories` → `mcp__serena__read_memory`
3. **Context7 MCP** → For external documentation fetching
4. **GitHub Search** → `mcp__github__search_repositories` for examples
5. **Web Search** → As last resort for current documentation

### Critical Anti-Hallucination Rules:
- ❌ **NEVER assume** a tool/library is installed - always verify first
- ❌ **NEVER guess** at command syntax - check documentation
- ❌ **NEVER skip** validation steps - they prevent cascade failures
- ✅ **ALWAYS test** commands in dry-run mode first (when available)
- ✅ **ALWAYS backup** before making destructive changes
- ✅ **ALWAYS verify** file paths exist before operations

[ ] Docker running: `docker ps | grep claude`
[ ] Pass configured: `pass list`
[ ] Backup verified: `ls ~/.claude/backups/`
[ ] Restore tested: `~/.claude/scripts/test-restore.sh`
[ ] All original tasks complete
[ ] All enhanced tasks complete
[ ] No critical errors in last 30 minutes
[ ] Documentation updated
```

### Critical Commands:
```bash
# MCP Management
claude mcp list                # Show all MCP connections
claude mcp install [server]    # Install new MCP server
claude mcp remove [server]     # Remove MCP server

# Backup/Restore
~/.claude/scripts/backup-now.sh      # Create backup
~/.claude/scripts/restore.sh [date]  # Restore from backup

# Validation
~/.claude/scripts/validate-system.sh # Full system check
~/.claude/scripts/test-commands.sh   # Test all commands
```

### Emergency Recovery:
```bash
# If something goes wrong:
/unfuck-this --diagnose        # Run diagnostics
/unfuck-this --restore [point] # Restore to checkpoint
/god-mode --emergency          # Full access for fixes
```

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### After Each Phase:
1. Update discovered tasks section
2. Document time variance (estimated vs actual)
3. Note any deviations from implementation strategy
4. Record lessons learned for future phases
5. Update anti-hallucination rules if new patterns found

### Questions to Ask:
- What documentation was missing?
- What assumptions proved wrong?
- What tools would have helped?
- What can be automated next time?

## 📝 Notes & Reminders

- **CRITICAL**: MCP fixes in Phase 1 block everything - prioritize these
- **IMPORTANT**: Always check overlap resolution table in implementation-strategy.md
- **REMEMBER**: Some tasks appear in both original and enhanced - do ONCE only
- **WARNING**: Phase 3 skip basic cron (T3.2-T3.8) - Airflow replaces it
- **TIP**: Run Docker pulls overnight to save time
