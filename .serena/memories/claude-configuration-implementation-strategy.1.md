# Claude Configuration Implementation Strategy

## Overview
Sequential implementation strategy for deploying the Claude Code Autonomous Intelligence System (CAIS) with both original and enhanced task lists.

**Total Implementation Time: 20 hours**
- Original Tasks: 11 hours (foundational)
- Enhanced Additions: 9 hours (production features)

## Critical Discovery
Enhanced task lists are NOT complete replacements! They add production features on top of original foundational tasks. Both must be implemented.

### Missing from Enhanced Lists:
- **Phase 1**: Browserbase, Taskmaster, MCP-Cron installations
- **Phase 2**: /security-audit command
- **Phase 3**: Basic log directory creation
- **Phase 4-6**: Various foundational tasks

## Implementation Order

### Day 1: Infrastructure Foundation (3 hours)
**Original Phase 1** → **Enhanced Phase 1 Additions**
- Fix MCP servers (filesystem, context7)
- Install missing MCPs (browserbase, taskmaster, mcp-cron)
- Setup backup directories
- Add Docker, Pass/GPG, enhanced monitoring

### Day 2: Command System (2 hours)
**Original Phase 2 (selective)** → **Enhanced Phase 2**
- Keep /security-audit from original
- Implement enhanced versions of other commands
- Add discovery system, validation, YAML chains

### Day 3: Automation (4 hours)
**Original Phase 3 (minimal)** → **Enhanced Phase 3**
- Create log directories from original
- Skip basic cron, implement Airflow instead
- Add webhooks, self-healing, alert escalation

### Day 4: Event Bus & Resilience (3.5 hours)
**Original Phase 4** → **Enhanced Phase 4**
- Basic event system first
- Add NATS JetStream, OpenTelemetry, chaos engineering

### Day 5: Learning Pipeline (4.5 hours)
**Original Phase 5** → **Enhanced Phase 5**
- Create basic learning infrastructure
- Containerize with Docker, add federated learning

### Day 6: Validation (3 hours)
**Original Phase 6** → **Enhanced Phase 6**
- Basic validation and testing
- Add OpenTelemetry monitoring, SLO management

## Key Dependencies

### Must Complete First:
- T1.12 (backup dirs) → Required by multiple phases
- T3.1 (log dirs) → Required by Airflow
- T4.1 (event config) → Required by NATS
- T5.1-T5.2 (seed files) → Required by containers

## Validation Checkpoints

After each day:
```bash
# Day 1: MCPs, Docker, Pass
claude mcp list | grep "✓ Connected"
docker ps | grep claude

# Day 2: Commands functional
~/.claude/scripts/test-commands.sh

# Day 3: Airflow operational
docker exec airflow-webserver airflow dags list

# Day 4: Events flowing
docker logs nats-streaming | grep "Stream ready"

# Day 5: Learning active
docker ps | grep learning

# Day 6: Full validation
~/.claude/scripts/validate-system.sh
```

## Critical Path
MCPs → Docker → Commands → Airflow → NATS → Learning → Validation

## Success Criteria
- All MCPs connected
- 9+ commands functional
- Airflow DAGs running
- NATS streaming events
- Learning pipeline producing patterns
- Validation score ≥9/10
- No critical alerts for 24 hours
