## Date: 2025-09-02
## Total Time: ~45 minutes

### ✅ ALL MCP SERVERS OPERATIONAL (7/7)

#### MCP Server Status
- ✅ **memory**: Connected (npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory)
- ✅ **playwright**: Connected (npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest)
- ✅ **github**: Connected (npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github)
- ✅ **serena**: Connected (uvx serena)
- ✅ **browserbase**: Connected (npx @browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase)
- ✅ **filesystem**: Connected (npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem)
- ✅ **context7**: Connected (npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest)

### Key Discoveries & Fixes

1. **Context7 Fix**: 
   - Wrong package: `mcp-remote https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`
   - Correct package: `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest`
   - Found via GitHub search of upstash/context7 repository

2. **Non-existent Packages**:
   - taskmaster MCP server doesn't exist in npm
   - mcp-cron doesn't exist in npm
   - These were likely placeholders in the original plan

3. **Available Alternatives Found**:
   - For task management: mcp-server-taskwarrior, todoist-mcp-server
   - For time/scheduling: @modelcontextprotocol/server-time (timezone only)
   - Decision: Proceed without these as they're not critical

### Infrastructure Achievements
- ✅ All 7 core MCP servers connected and operational
- ✅ Backup/restore system fully functional
- ✅ Health monitoring with auto-retry working
- ✅ Pass/GPG secrets management configured
- ✅ Docker compose ready as fallback
- ✅ Integration test suite created

### System Health
- Docker: Running (4 containers)
- Pass Store: Configured (11 secrets)
- Backup: Created and verified
- Response Time: <3 seconds for all MCP commands
- Retry Logic: Tested with exponential backoff

### Ready for Phase 2
All critical infrastructure is now operational. The system has:
- Full MCP connectivity
- Secure secret management
- Automated backup/recovery
- Health monitoring
- Docker fallback options

Phase 2 (Command System Development) can now proceed with confidence.
