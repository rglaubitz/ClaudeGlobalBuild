# Claude Global Project - Current Status
## Last Updated: 2025-09-02

### Project Overview
Building an autonomous AI system to transform Claude Code into a self-improving intelligence platform with 24/7 operation capability.

### Completed Phases

#### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Complete)
- All 7 MCP servers operational (memory, playwright, github, serena, browserbase, filesystem, context7)
- Docker and Pass/GPG configured
- Backup/restore system functional
- Health monitoring with auto-retry

#### ✅ Phase 2: Command System Development (Complete)
- 10 core commands implemented
- Command discovery system (`/help`)
- Input validation framework
- Command chains (YAML workflows)
- Test suite operational

### Upcoming Phases

#### Phase 3: Automation & Scheduling (Next)
**Original Tasks (30 min)**:
- T3.1: Create log directories
- T3.9: Health check script
- T3.10: Notification script base
- SKIP T3.2-T3.8: Basic cron (replaced by Airflow)

**Enhanced Tasks (3.5 hours)**:
- Apache Airflow Docker setup
- DAG configurations
- MCP-Cron integration
- Self-healing systems
- GitHub webhooks
- Alert escalation

#### Phase 4: Event Bus & Resilience
- NATS JetStream setup
- CloudEvents schema
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Circuit breakers
- Chaos engineering

#### Phase 5: Learning Pipeline
- Federated learning with Flower
- Pattern extraction and validation
- Scoring and quality gates
- User approval gates

#### Phase 6: Validation & Monitoring
- OpenTelemetry setup
- Property-based testing
- SLO management
- Final system validation
