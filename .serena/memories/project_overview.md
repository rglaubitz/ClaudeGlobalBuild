# Project Overview: Claude Code Autonomous Intelligence System (CAIS)

## Purpose
Transform Claude Code from a coding assistant into a self-improving AI command center with 24/7 autonomous operation. This configuration and documentation repository builds an autonomous AI system with continuous learning capabilities.

## Project Type
- Documentation and configuration repository
- Multi-agent system architecture
- MCP server integration framework
- No active code implementation yet (primarily planning/documentation phase)

## Key Goals
- 10x productivity increase in development tasks
- 90% reduction in repetitive workflow time  
- 50% decrease in bug discovery time
- 24/7 autonomous operation with <1% error rate
- 5x faster project completion through intelligent task breakdown

## System Components
1. **Command Center (~/.claude/)** - Global Claude configuration
2. **Learning Pipeline (~/claude-research/)** - Continuous improvement system
3. **Multi-Agent System** - Specialized agents (Planner, Researcher, Implementer, Tester, Documenter, Reflector)
4. **MCP Server Integration** - Extended capabilities through Model Context Protocol

## Repository Structure
- `.claude/` - Claude configuration directory
- `mcp-documentation/` - MCP server documentation
- `task-management/` - Phase-based implementation planning
- Configuration files (CLAUDE.md, PRD, ultimate config guide)
