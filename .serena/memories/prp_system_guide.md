2. **`execute-prp`** - Implement the generated plan

## PRP Structure
- Detailed task breakdown
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Validation gates at each step
- Rollback procedures for failures
- Performance metrics

## When to Use PRP
- Complex multi-step features
- System-wide changes
- New agent implementations
- Critical infrastructure updates
- Features requiring careful planning

## PRP Workflow
1. Generate PRP with clear requirements
2. Review generated plan
3. Execute PRP with validation
4. Monitor execution progress
5. Validate completion criteria

## Quality Standards
- All PRPs include executable validation steps
- 100% of commands have rollback capability
- Clear success metrics defined
- Error handling specified
- Documentation requirements included
