# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Key Concepts

The Model Context Protocol enables:
- **Seamless integration** between LLM applications and external data sources
- **Standardized communication** replacing fragmented custom integrations
- **Universal adapter** functionality for AI systems

## Architecture

MCP uses a client-server architecture:
- **MCP Clients**: AI applications or agents that want to access external systems (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf)
- **MCP Servers**: Data sources and tools that expose functionality to clients
- **Host Process**: Container and coordinator managing multiple clients

## Protocol Foundation

Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides:
- Stateful session protocol
- Context exchange capabilities
- Sampling coordination between clients and servers
- Standard message types for prompts, tools, and resources

## Key Benefits

1. **Eliminates the NÃ—M problem**: No need for custom connectors for each AI-data combination
2. **Open standard**: Community-driven development and adoption
3. **Flexible deployment**: Supports both local and remote communication
4. **Ecosystem growth**: Developers can build and share connectors

## Current Adoption

Early adopters include:
- **Companies**: Block, Apollo
- **Development Tools**: Zed, Replit, Codeium, Sourcegraph
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI, Google DeepMind (following Anthropic's lead)
